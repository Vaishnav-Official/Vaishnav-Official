# 👋 Namaste, I’m Kumar Vaishnav  

**💡 Data & BI Analyst | SQL • Python • Power BI • Tableau • Excel • Snowflake**  

I turn messy, complex data into clear, actionable insights — from **chai‑stained ledgers** in a family shop to **enterprise dashboards** at Accenture.  
I believe good analytics is about asking the right questions, understanding the business, and delivering solutions people actually use.
